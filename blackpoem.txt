Not so sinister poem

The sky is black
The flowers are black
My soul is black
My dog is black
My room is blck

My pony is black
My USB is black
Denzel Washington is black
Darth Vader is black
The universe is obscure
My cellphone is black

Generals gathered at their masses,
Just like witches at black masses,
Rabbit minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerers of death's construction.

Sometimes the materials are black but for the time,
change the colors with other more beautifull, 
You need a creativity, imagination and expand your mind,
And with a time the colors chainge iqual with your live.

Oh Yeah!

But the rainbow is still full of colors.
And FIME is green.

The end
