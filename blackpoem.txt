Not so sinister poem

The sky is black
The flowers are black
My soul is black
My dog is black

My pony is black
My USB is black
The nigh is oscure
Darth Vader is black
The universe is obscure

Generals gathered at their masses,
Just like witches at black masses,
Rabbit minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerers of death's construction.
Play soccer 
My house is black 
Oh Yeah!

But the rainbow is still full of colors.
And FIME is green.

The end
