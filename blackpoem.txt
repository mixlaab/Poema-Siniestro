I need some sinister ideas for my poem
because it is not sinister
Not so sinister poem

The sky is black
The flowers are black
My soul is black
My dog is black

My pony is black
My USB is black
Denzel Washington is black
Darth Vader is black
The universe is obscure

Generals gathered at their masses,
Just like witches at black masses,
Rabbit minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerers of death's construction.

Oh Yeah!

But the rainbow is still full of colors.
And FIME is green.

But why is FIME green?
Why not dark?
Will it be as green as the trees?
Will it be as green as the grass?
So many questions and only one answer.

The answer is simple, FIME is not dark 
because there are people prepared 
to always have a spark of light.
and its color represents the relaxing 
and refreshing that induces to whom contemplates 
sensations of serenity and harmony.

The end
