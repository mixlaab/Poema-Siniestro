Not so sinister poem

The sky is black
The flowers are black
My soul is black
My dog is black

My pony is black
My USB is black
Denzel Washington is black
Darth Vader is black
The universe is obscure

I Will like to take
a ball of black paint
and throw it against the night sky

el humo del cigarro
te deja mal  olor 

Generals gathered at their masses,
Just like witches at black masses,
Rabbit minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerers of death's construction.

Oh Yeah!

But the rainbow is still full of colors.
And FIME is green.

The end
