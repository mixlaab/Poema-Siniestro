Not so sinister poem

The sky is black
The flowers are black
My soul is black
My dog is black

My pony is black
My USB is black
Denzel Washington is black
Darth Vader is black
The universe is obscure

Generals gathered at their masses,
Just like witches at black masses,
Rabbit minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerers of death's construction.

Como en el teléfono tú me decías 
Que yo era tu fantasía, que por mí morías 

Oh Yeah!

But the rainbow is still full of colors.
And FIME is green.

The end
