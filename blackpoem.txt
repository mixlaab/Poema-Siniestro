Sinister-er poem

The sky is black
The flowers are black
My soul is black
My dog is black

My pony is black
My USB is black
Denzel Washington is black
Darth Vader is black
The universe is obscure

Generals gathered at their masses,
Just like witches at black masses,
Rabbit minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerers of death's construction.

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down and build us back again
So why do go back that could leave this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

Oh Yeah!

But the rainbow is still full of colors.
And FIME is green.

The End
