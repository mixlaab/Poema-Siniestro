Not so sinister poem

The sky is blue
The flowers are blue
My soul is blue
My dog is blue 

My pony is blue
My USB is blue
Denzel Washington is blue
Darth Vader is blACK
The universe is obscure

Generals gathered at their masses,
Just like witches at black masses,
Rabbit minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerers of death's construction.

Oh Yeah!
