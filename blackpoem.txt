Not so sinister poem

The sky is black
The flowers are black
My soul is black
My dog is black

My pony is black
My USB is black
Denzel Washington is black
Darth Vader is black
The universe is obscure

Generals gathered at their masses,
Just like witches at black masses,
Rabbit minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerers of death's construction.

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same

Oh Yeah!

But the rainbow is still full of colors.
And FIME is green.

The end
